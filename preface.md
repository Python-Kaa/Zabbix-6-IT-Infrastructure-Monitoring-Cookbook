Make sure you have a virtualization environment ready to create virtual machines for use with the recipes. VirtualBox, VMware, or any type of client/hypervisor will do.

Throughout the book, we will make use of VIM to edit files, so make sure to install it. If you do not feel comfortable using VIM, you can substitute the command for NANO or anything else you prefer.
